screens1description: Marmot came to us looking for a fresh new site for their upcoming season. Starting with a full content-audit, our team then ran a card sorting exercise to outline assumptions and user expectations around navigation. These findings then allowed our team to create intuitive page names, groupings and hierarchy.

screens2title: Mountain Love
screens2description: Our love of Jasper’s Canadian Rockies inspired us from start to finish. Breathtaking photography and airy layouts were key to selling the Marmot experience with the goal of getting users out the door and on the mountain. An essential part of this site was streamlining Marmot’s business operations. The finished product pulls in live data from the mountain’s thermometers and webcams and allows staff to easily update runs, chairs and grooming reports from anywhere on the mountain.
