screens1title: Breathtaking Views
screens1description: With a handful of successful Skytram collaborations already under our belt, we jumped at the opportunity to re-think and design their new site. As a designer you can't ask for much more than a mountain-town client with phenomenal photography.

screens2title: Our Solution
screens2description: With a heavy focus on usability, we started by conducting a content-audit of the existing site which we then re-organized and re-named into a more intuitive site structure - ensuring users find the information they need with ease. The design and layouts mimic the airy atmosphere of the mountain, breaking down content into meaningful groupings and letting the scenic photography do all the talking.
