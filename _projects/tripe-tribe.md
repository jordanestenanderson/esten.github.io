screens1description: Trip Tribe had run successful trips for years before we met, but where they excelled in technology and community building they lacked in design and user experience. That's where we came in, re-thinking their application screen by screen from user-flow to design.

screens2description: When designing a web application of this size it becomes less about style than it is about user experience and intuition.
